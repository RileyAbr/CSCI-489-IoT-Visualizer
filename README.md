# Packet Sniffers

Packet Sniffers was a university project researching the ethical issues behind cell phones and Bluetooth signals. In this experiment, a mock IoT network was designed to anonymously collect MAC addresses of nearby mobile devices (only from our consenting participants, of course!) via their beacon frame responses. From there, we performed analysis on frequency and distribution of the most common addressesâ€”showing how a malicious actor could use the same IoT devices and data for evil. 

For this project, I served the role of front-end dev to build a simple visualizer to show off the data collected.
